# Etch-a-Sketch

This project looked impossible from the description, but wound up being manageable. The hardest part to figure out was how to get the new divs to fit evenly into the box - I finally assigned them a width and height derived from the number input...there may be a more elegant method but this worked. I wrote out my plan in advance and added substeps to the assignment until I understood how to accomplish each step. I also went a little beyond the assignment and assigned the bonus credit (colors) version to its own button. Overall - this was a fun one!
